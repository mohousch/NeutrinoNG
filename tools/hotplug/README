hotplug-ng - a /sbin/hotplug replacement and auto module loader in c

To use:

- You must be running a 2.6 version of the Linux kernel.

- Your 2.6 kernel must have had CONFIG_HOTPLUG enabled when it was built.

- Build the project:
	make

  Note:
      There are a number of different flags that you can use when building
      hotplug-ng.  They are as follows:
	prefix
		set this to the default root that you want hotplug-ng to be
		installed into.  This works just like the 'configure --prefix'
		script does.  Default value is ''.  Only override this if you
		really know what you are doing.
	USE_KLIBC
		if set to 'true', hotplug-ng is built and linked against the
		included version of klibc.  Default value is 'false'.
	USE_LOG
		if set to 'true', hotplug-ng will emit messages to the syslog
		when it creates or removes device nodes.  This is helpful to
		see what hotplug-ng is doing.  This is enabled by default.
		Note, if you are building hotplug-ng against klibc it is
		recommended that you disable this option (due to klibc's syslog
		implementation.)
	DEBUG
		if set to 'true', debugging messages will be sent to the syslog
		as hotplug-ng is run.  Default value is 'false'.
	KERNEL_DIR
		If this is not set it will default to /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
		This is used if USE_KLIBC=true to find the kernel include
		directory that klibc needs to build against.  This must be set
		if you are not building hotplug-ng while running a 2.6 kernel.

      So, if you want to build hotplug using klibc with debugging messages, you
      would do:
	make USE_KLIBC=true DEBUG=true

- Install the project:
	make install

- Add and remove devices from the system and marvel as modules are automatically
  loaded faster than they ever have been.

- If you later get sick of it, uninstall it:
	make uninstall


Development and documentation help is very much appreciated, see the TODO
file for a list of things left to be done.
