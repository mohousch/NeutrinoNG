This is a short list of things that needs to be done.  They are in no specific
order.  I will gladly accept patches for any of these items, or any other stuff
people offer up.

- more autoloaders (need to at least support what the bash scripts do.)  We
  are missing the following at least:
  	- input
	- dasd
	- ieee1394

- documentation!  We really should document this boot process
- man pages!
